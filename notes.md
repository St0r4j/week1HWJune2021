# Git Notes

Git Status: To check the status of your git repository and see which branch, files changed and etc.

```sh
git status
```
* Good note to perform this after every step.

Git Stage: to stage the files that are ready to be committed

```sh
git add [file.name] ie. `git add index.html`
```

* You can add all files that have been marked for change under `git status` with `git add .`

Git Commit: Once the files are ready to be committed

```sh
git commit -m 'ADD TEXT HERE'
```

* Add a message! Make sure you use the quotes

Git Push

```sh
git push
```

* Verify on GitHub
